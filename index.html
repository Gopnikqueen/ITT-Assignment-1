<h1> My IT Profile </h1>
<h2>About me</h2>

<img src="Headshot.jpg" Width="250" Height="300"> 

<p> My Name is Lori Williams, or s3824209 according to RMIT. </p>
<p> Born in Maitland, NSW which is about 38km inland from Newcastle, on the 29th of August 1997 and becoming the original pain in the arse for my Mum as I broke her tailbone while I was still in the womb shortly before birth. </p>
<p> Moved down state to the far south coast after my father graduated from the Police Academy in Goulburn in 2002 and haven’t left since. I attended the local schools and joined 222 Army Cadet Unit which I reached to the rank of SGT/Acting Warrant Officer Class 2, completing my HSC in 2015 from Moruya High School. </P>

<p> As of now, I live with my partner Matthew, and have been together for close to 3 years and we are both the humble servants of two animals as our overlords… A dopey black Labrador puppy who still doesn’t understand the concept of personal space, and a tiny but loud grey Blue Russian who only yells instead of a normal meow.... like a normal cat. </p>

<h2> Some slightly interesting facts about myself</h2>
<p> - I am the only daughter of my family and 3rd eldest out of 3 brothers. Eldest being a Military Police Officer in the K9 Unit up in QLD for the Army, the 2nd is studying for his Bachelor of Science at University of Wollongong, the youngest has just completed Year 12. </P>
<p> - The tip of my left index finger was chopped of by a heavy wooden door when I was 9mths old. Lucky it was saved thanks to surgery but unfortunately, I can’t play any stringed instruments. </p>
<p> - I am a very big coffee snob. Can’t drink coffee unless it’s been freshly grinded and dripped. This princess likes her coffee FRESH.</p>
<p> - Avid Formula 1 fan and Legend of Zelda fan. Can normally be found watching anime or reading the manga or studying. Currently have an overwhelming urge to play S.T.A.L.K.E.R again.... Thanks Matt. >.> </p>
<p> - I have a terrible ear for accents but strangely enough, not for Eastern European accents. </p>


<h1> My Interest in IT </h1>
<p> My immense love for IT and computers started when I first heard the noise of dial up... strange, I know.</p>
<p> When my Dad cracked open the old family laptop and tried to fix the faulty charging point, and after the illegitimate Office 365 Trojan malware fiasco, it kicked everything into motion of what I wanted to do in life.
<p> Since then, I've tried to centre myself around them through gaming via consoles, and the PCs at my schools from Apple and Microsoft to Linux.</p>
<p> Tried to signup for any IT related classes in my senior years, especially for my HSC electives, but was cut due to lack of interest from both students and staff.</p>
<p> Since graduation, I’ve worked at a local Telco as a Customer Service Representative then as a Technical Support Operator, assisting endusers with installation and setup of either, ADSL, NBN, Satellite or Mobile Broadband connections as well as configuring said services when required. As of 2019, I still work for them but now as a Billing Analyst in a small but closely knitted team. Currently we are mediating and migrating over 100,000 customers from the old accounts and billing platform that’s been in place for years, to our own platform which is to be launched at the start of 2020. Not only are we moving our customers, but also archiving and importing all our plans, past and present. This also includes the rates, inclusions, exclusions etc. Not an easy job sadly, but we power through it thanks to teamwork and communication. </p>

<p> Why did I choose RMIT? I chose RMIT back during my final year of High School and to do the exact same subject as I'm doing now. Sadly, I didn't go through with it due to my mental health.</p>
<p> I'm ecstatic to finally follow through with my dream, keen to learn all there is to IT and everything related... Programming, IT systems, Cyber Security and networking.

<h1> Ideal Job </h1>
<p>While I love every aspect of IT, my favourite field of it that would be my dream to have a career in would be Cyber Security.</p>
<p> I have come across a job on Seek.com.au in regard to a Cyber Security Analysist Junior position that would be an ideal starting point for my career and to progress.</p>
<p> This position would have me working in a 24x7 Security Operations Centre with other Security Analysts that would be responsible for the following:</p>
<p> - Monitoring Networks/endpoints for any events or alerts for active threats,</p>
<p> - Analysing any events from multiple sources like network intrusion systems and host-based intrusion prevention tools. </p>
<p> Eg, Application whitelisting, AV Security Suite, and host intrusion prevention systems.</p>
<p> - Monitoring and assessing any incoming threats or vulnerabilities and rectifying said issues.</p>
<p> - Maintaining any deployed security tools.</p>
<p> - Constant review, and improvements to the overall security.</p>

<p> The qualifications for this position are out of my reach for the time being, as they require at least 1-year experience in a Security Analytics role or in a security operations/network admin role.</p>
<p> Sadly, I do not have the current experience to apply and be successful for this role, hence why I'm studying with RMIT, to further hone and expand the knowledge in order to be successful. I've also requested from my current work if there's any positions related to IT.</p>

<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
<p>The screenshot you'll see below are the results of three separate tests, Myer-Briggs, learning and psychometric tests. </p>

<p> </p>
<p> Over all with the results, they didn't come to too much of a surprise. Incidentally it the same as what my manager had already described a while ago and the learning test results were almost identical to the one I took back in High School. The mechanical aptitude test surprised me quite a bit as I initially believed I had gotten most of them wrong. </p>
<p> As I already work in a very small team and heavily rely on one another to get our objective completed. So for me, what I find important in building a team is trust, communication and the same goal in mind. </p>

<h1> Project Ideas </h1>

<h2> Project Overview </h2>
<p> For this assignment, my idea is an automatic programmable plant watering system. This would be used for gardens that either have little to no rainfall and for gardens what cannot be watered on a regular basis like fulltime workers or for areas on heavy water restrictions. In theory, this would be programmed to release water on a timer, for a specific amount, or to be able to operate on solar to release the water. This could be easily achieved with a Raspberry Pi 3 as the price is low and the board is small enough to be concealed in a water/weatherproof case. </p>


<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p> The motivation for the automatic watering system was for those who try to maintain a small garden but having either no time to water, like myself as I work fulltime then dedicated to studying during any spare time, areas on heavy water restrictions or with severe dry humidity. I personally want this to succeed as I crushes my heart that my flowers keep dying from lack of water due to having next to no time to tend to them. The heavy water restrictions make this difficult also in wake of the recent fires. </p>


<h2> Description </h2>
<p> The automatic watering system would have several features: </p>
<p> -	The device would allow you to either manually program a time or times for the water to be released. This means you can have it programmed to work more than once a day if the plant or vegetable require frequent watering. </p>
<p> -	Program for how much water is released to the plant, this would come from a water reservoir that can be refilled at any time. This also allows for liquid fertiliser to be mixed in and slowly released. </p>
<p> -	Length of time the plant is watered. Say you want a plant constantly watered over a 3-hour period; you can program it to slowly water the plant over those requested hours. </p>
<p> -	Different interchangeable attachments so you can choose how your plant/veg receives its water. You can have the water either sprayed over the top, delivered directly to the roots or on the surface of the sod at the base of the plant. It’ll also have an attachment for multiple hoses but those would be only for on the service or directly to the roots, but this means you can water up to several plans at once from the one device. </p>
<p> -	No mounting onto hard surfaces, the device can be placed easily in the garden itself. Can be mounted onto pegs and pushed into the ground to keep the device in place and hidden. </p>
<p> -	Mini solar panel to power device, this would create less of a fuss of plugging the device in or constantly charging it. This also makes the device environmentally friendly as it uses a renewable source of energy to power. </p>
<p> -	Waterproof and weatherproof hard casing that would able to withstand Australia’s harsh climate. Any joints would be sealed with solvent bonding to further improve and prevent any leaks. </p>
<p> -	Water/weatherproof rubber buttons and display screen. I prefer a basic display without a blacklight so it can be read easier in the sun and rubber buttons to further prevent any water leaks to the internal components. </p>
<p> -	Works both indoors and outdoors. </p> 


<h2> Tools & Technologies </h2>
<p> The tools and technology for this project can be easily sourced from local retailers like tech shops or Bunnings. </p>
<p> -	The raspberry pi 3 board can be bought online for a cheap price. NOOBS for the RPi as it contains Raspbian and LibreELEC. </p>
<p> -	Regular hand and precision tools I already own so there’s no need for me to purchase any more, it also helps that my Father’s garage is well-equip if I ever need to borrow anything. </p> 
<p> -	A simple black and white display and buttons so the device can be used. </p>
<p> -	Water reservoir that can hold at least 1 litre. </p>
<p> -	Flexible thin tubing so the attachments can be made into what shape that’s required. </p>
<p> -	Mini Solar panels for providing power to the device. </p>
<p> -	Water/weatherproof plastic to create the housing of the mobo, pump etc. Looking towards Acrylic as it's durable, good for weather and easy to solvent bond together. </p>


<h2> Skills Required </h2>
<p> Obviously for a project like this, skills in programming as I would have to create a program that can calculate how much water to release, what time and to repeat if required. Knowing what hardware is required and assembly of the device would be a challenge, but I do have experience with computer systems including a bit of Raspberry Pi and can be easily acquired, same can be said for the software. The other components, like the small pump, tubing, and solvent seal can be purchased from the local hardware store. The acrylic casing would be a bit harder to get my hands on but not impossible. The display, buttons and solar panel can be purchased online. </p>


<h2> Outcome </h2>
<p> If it’s successful, then woohoo! That means I can continue to finetune it and make it more durable and reliable. Add more features like soil sensor to show an indication of hydration of the soil it’s detecting, an external temperature sensor to constantly read the outside temp, including air humidity and water plants accordingly. If it fails, then I try again. Until it works, my main point of focus is trial and error. This is stepping outside of my comfort zone; I want the challenge and I want to be able to make this project successful.  I just want my plants to live. </p>
